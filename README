Linode (http://www.linode.com) is a VPS host which supports Arch Linux servers
and custom kernels. This project gives you an Arch kernel for your Linode.

linux-linode is designed to closely track Arch kernel development while being as
resource friendly as possible. Compiles specifically for Linode's CPUs and
removes unneeded hardware support (i.e. almost everything besides xen block dev,
NICs & console). Also defaults to removing all filesystems but ext3 and
compiling in many things that are usually modules (fuse, dm-crypt for example)
but you can of course nconfig whatever you want. :)

Includes a grub boot menu where Linode expects to find it. You do NOT need grub,
grub2, grub-legacy or any other. grub-legacy is a conflict because of menu.lst.

This is a 64-bit kernel, so make sure you're using their 64-bit Arch image!

Steps to use:

	1) pacman -Syu
	2) pacman -U /path/to/linux-linode-*-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
	3) reboot your Linode with "kernel" set to: pv-grub-x86_64
	4) report bugs ;)
